## Introduction

Unlock the full potential of your enterprise data with the **Cohere Enterprise RAG Subnet**. In today's AI-driven landscape, leveraging proprietary information is the key to a competitive edge. However, building and scaling a secure, high-performance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system presents a significant challenge for many organizations.

This Bittensor subnet provides a decentralized, incentivized solution. It allows enterprises to supercharge their AI applications with their own private data, tapping into a competitive network of retrieval models without ever compromising on security or performance.

## What This Subnet Solves for an Enterprise

By participating in the CERS subnet, businesses can overcome common RAG hurdles and gain a distinct advantage:

-   **üöÄ Superior RAG Performance**: Move beyond generic retrieval models. Leverage a global network of miners who are incentivized to develop and operate highly specialized and optimized retrieval algorithms tailored to your specific domain and data types.

-   **üîí Uncompromised Data Security**: Your proprietary documents and sensitive information **never** leave your secure environment. The subnet is designed with a privacy-first architecture that operates exclusively on non-reversible data embeddings. (See [Security and Data Privacy](#-security-and-data-privacy) for details).

-   **üí∞ Cost-Effective Scalability**: Offload the heavy computational and maintenance burden of indexing and retrieval to a decentralized network. This allows you to pay for top-tier performance without the massive overhead of building and maintaining complex infrastructure in-house.

-   **üß© Unmatched Customization**: The subnet fosters a competitive ecosystem where miners can specialize in different industries (e.g., finance, healthcare, legal) and data formats. This gives you access to a marketplace of tailored solutions that best fit your unique business needs.

-   **ü§ù Powered by Cohere & Bittensor**: This subnet brings together Cohere's leadership in enterprise-grade AI and Large Language Models with Bittensor's robust, decentralized incentive network, creating a powerful and reliable foundation for your RAG applications.

## How it works on Bittensor

The Bittensor blockchain hosts multiple self-contained incentive mechanisms called **subnets**. Subnets are playing fields in which:
- Subnet miners who produce value, and
- Subnet validators who produce consensus

determine together the proper distribution of TAO for the purpose of incentivizing the creation of value, i.e., generating digital commodities, such as intelligence or data. 

Each subnet consists of:
- Subnet miners and subnet validators.
- A protocol using which the subnet miners and subnet validators interact with one another. This protocol is part of the incentive mechanism.
- The Bittensor API using which the subnet miners and subnet validators interact with Bittensor's onchain consensus engine [Yuma Consensus](https://bittensor.com/documentation/validating/yuma-consensus). The Yuma Consensus is designed to drive these actors: subnet validators and subnet miners, into agreement on who is creating value and what that value is worth.

## üîí Security and Data Privacy

In an enterprise context, data privacy is paramount. This subnet is designed with a **privacy-first architecture** where sensitive enterprise data is never exposed to the public network or the miners.

### Architecture Overview

The following diagram illustrates the data flow and the separation of concerns between the enterprise environment and the Bittensor network, ensuring that raw data never leaves the enterprise's secure perimeter.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Enterprise Secure Environment"
        User((User)) -- "Asks a question" --> RAGApp["RAG Application"]
        RAGApp -- "Sends query to Validator" --> Validator
        Validator -- "Returns Document IDs" --> RAGApp
        RAGApp -- "Retrieves documents by ID" --> SecureDB[("Secure Datastore")]
        SecureDB -- "Document content" --> RAGApp
        RAGApp -- "Generates final response" --> User
        RawDocs[("Raw Documents")] --> EmbedGen["Embedding Generation"]
        EmbedGen -- "Indexing:<br>Embeddings + Doc IDs" --> Miner
    end

    subgraph "Bittensor Network (CERS Subnet)"
        Validator["Validator"] -- "Sends query embedding" --> Miner["Miner<br>(Vector Index)"]
        Miner -- "Returns relevant Document IDs" --> Validator
    end

    style SecureDB fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style RawDocs fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Here‚Äôs how it works:
1.  **Data Stays On-Premise**: The enterprise's raw documents (the knowledge base) remain within their secure environment.
2.  **Embeddings, Not Data**: The enterprise generates numerical representations (embeddings) of their documents. Only these non-reversible embeddings, along with anonymous document IDs, are sent to the miners for indexing.
3.  **Miner's Role**: Miners store and maintain a searchable index of these embeddings. They perform similarity searches based on query embeddings provided by validators. **Miners never see the original document content.**
4.  **Secure Retrieval**: When a miner finds relevant results, it returns only the corresponding document IDs to the validator.
5.  **Final-Mile RAG**: The enterprise uses these IDs to retrieve the full document text from its own secure database to complete the RAG process.

This model ensures that companies can leverage the decentralized power of the Bittensor network for high-performance retrieval without ever compromising the confidentiality of their proprietary data.

## Getting Started

This guide provides the essential steps to get the Cohere Enterprise RAG Subnet up and running.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- `pip` and `venv`

You also need to have `bittensor` installed. If you haven't installed it yet, follow the instructions here.

### 1. Clone & Install

First, clone the repository and navigate into the directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CohereAI-Labs/cers-subnet.git
cd cers-subnet
```

Next, set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies. Using a virtual environment is highly recommended.
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configure Your Wallet

To interact with the Bittensor network, you need a wallet with a coldkey and a hotkey.
If you don't have one, create it using the Bittensor CLI (`btcli`):
```bash
# Create a new coldkey
btcli wallet new_coldkey --wallet.name my_wallet

# Create a new hotkey for your wallet
btcli wallet new_hotkey --wallet.name my_wallet --wallet.hotkey default
```

### 3. Run

You can participate in the subnet as either a miner or a validator.

#### For Miners

To run a miner, use the following command:
```bash
python neurons/miner.py --netuid <your-netuid> --wallet.name my_wallet --wallet.hotkey default --logging.debug --miner.api_key <your_secure_api_key>
```

**For validators:**
```bash
python neurons/validator.py --netuid <your-netuid> --wallet.name my_wallet --wallet.hotkey default --logging.debug
```

For more detailed instructions, including how to register your keys and run on different networks (local, testnet, mainnet), please refer to our full documentation:
